# Gen production TTTT_5f_SMEFT

This repository includes samples, cards, and models used for the four top five flavor Standard Model Efective Field Theory MC simulations at a center of mass energy of 13.6 TeV.

We generated the matrix elements with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO version 3.4.2, the patron shower with Pythia8, and the detector simulation with DELPHES.

We present samples for 30.000 events and 300.000 events withe the full MC simulation.
