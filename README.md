# Gen production TTTT_5f_SMEFT

This repository includes samples, cards, and the model used for the 4-top MC simulations for five flavors with SMEFT at the center of mass energy of 13.6 TeV.

We generated the matrix elements with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO version 3.5.1, the patron shower with Pythia8, and the detector simulation with DELPHES.

We present one sample with 30.000 events and one for 300.000 events. We include five Wilson coefficients that affect the 4-top interaction presented in the UFO model $c_{tt1}$, $c_{Qt1}$ and $c_{Qt8}$.
