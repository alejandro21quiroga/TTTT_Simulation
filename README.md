# Gen production TTTT_5f_SMEFT

This repository includes samples, cards, and models used for the four top MC simulations at a center of mass energy of 13.6 TeV.

We generated the matrix elements with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO version 3.4.2, the patron shower with Pythia8, and the detector simulation with DELPHES.
