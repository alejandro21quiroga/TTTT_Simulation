# Gen production TTTT_5f_SMEFT

This repository includes samples, cards, and the model used for the 4-top five flavor Standard Model Efective Field Theory MC simulations at a center of mass energy of 13.6 TeV.

We generated the matrix elements with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO version 3.5.1, the patron shower with Pythia8, and the detector simulation with DELPHES.

We present one small sample with 30.000 events and one full sample with 300.000 events. We include five different Wilson coefficients that affect the 4-top interaction, $t_{t}$.
